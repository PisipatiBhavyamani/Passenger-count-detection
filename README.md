# Passenger-count-detection

This project focuses on accurately detecting and counting passengers boarding a bus using object detection with YOLOv8. A video capturing the boarding process is analyzed, and passengers are identified and counted through a trained model. The training data is prepared using LabelImg, a graphical image annotation tool, which helps in labeling and creating the dataset required for the YOLOv8 model. This project aims to provide a reliable and automated solution for passenger count detection, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in monitoring passenger flow.
